**Step 1**

### 

Task Understanding: Develop an integrated Universal Knowledge Framework (UKFW) system using Python FastAPI (backend) and Next.js App Router (frontend) to serve and interact with the Universal Knowledge Graph (UKG), focusing on core principles: hierarchical knowledge graph, 13-axis multi-dimensional structure, unified system coordination, in-memory simulation, AI-driven reasoning, simulation of expertise, recursive refinement, compliance, performance optimization, and extensibility. Emphasis is on accurate representation of the graph structure/axes, support for multi-modal AI queries and reasoning, UI for visualization/exploration, and engineering for scalability, security, and compliance. The next actionable deep dive is on modeling and implementing the 13-axis coordinate system and the role of each axis.

Execution Strategy:

1. Begin with a requirements and systems analysis session to ground work in UKFW/UKG principles and map use cases, compliance, security, and extensibility considerations. 2. Model the knowledge graph schema, focusing on pillars and especially the 13-axis coordinate system, with input from domain and graph modeling experts. 3. Simultaneously implement backend FastAPI core (serving API endpoints for knowledge navigation and reasoning) and draft the data/frontend API contract. 4. Develop AI-driven modules (reasoning, expert simulation, recursive refinement) and iteratively integrate these into the backend. 5. Build the Next.js app router frontend, collaborating with backend devs to expose and interact with all major data/AI endpoints. 6. Enforce best-practices security (authn/z, role management, compliance), prioritize privacy and resilience, and set up robust CI/CD for deployment. 7. Engineer and benchmark performance and scalability using simulation modules and advanced partitioning/indexing. 8. Write detailed docs, test cases (including edge-case validation and chaos/concurrency testing), and establish a roadmap for continual improvement as the UKFW is validated and scaled.

Subtasks:

1. Requirements Analysis and Specification (Priority: 1, Expertise: Knowledge engineering, software architecture, information systems analysis) Description: Conduct a full analysis of the UKFW/UKG requirements, map out the data structures (pillars, axes), workflows (AI query, recursive refinement), and user flows (frontend-backend interaction). Produce detailed architecture and API specs accommodating future extensibility, compliance, and security. Dependencies: None
2. Knowledge Graph Schema and Axis Modeling (Priority: 2, Expertise: Graph modeling, semantic web/knowledge graphs, YAML/data serialization) Description: Design and implement the hierarchical Pillar Level system (PL01–PL87) and the 13-axis multi-dimensional coordinate system schema. Specify YAML structures and map these to database (simulated/in-memory and/or graph database backend) and API representations. Highlight axis purposes (eg. Axis 7: Octopus Node System, Axis 11: Unified System Coordination) and interoperability. Prepare stubs with metadata (provenance, confidence, compliance tags). Dependencies: s1
3. Backend: FastAPI Implementation of UKG Core Services (Priority: 3, Expertise: Python, FastAPI, API design, in-memory computing, AI/ML integration) Description: Develop Python/FastAPI backend to load, manipulate, and serve the UKG model, supporting endpoints for node/axis/pillar queries, AI-driven inference, confidence calculation, branch/depth navigation, and meta-data enrichment. Integrate simulation modules such as in-memory storage, recursive refinement, and compliance checks. Create OpenAPI specs for the service. Dependencies: s2
4. AI Reasoning and Expert Simulation Modules (Priority: 4, Expertise: AI/ML reasoning, simulation, agent-based modeling, Python) Description: Implement AI-driven components: Tree of Thought/Algorithm of Thought reasoning, recursive refinement, domain expert simulation (using role libraries), and autonomous validation (Layer 3 agents). Integrate knowledge algorithms (retrieval, validation, learning, compliance, etc.) into backend. Dependencies: s3
5. Frontend: Next.js App Router Knowledge UI (Priority: 5, Expertise: React/Next.js, UI/UX, data visualization (graphs), API integration) Description: Develop a Next.js frontend/app router that visualizes the graph structure (pillars/axes/nodes), enables advanced query interfaces (text, graph traversal, expert emulation), and displays responses including provenance, confidence, simulated expert opinions. Integrate with FastAPI endpoints, optimize for usability, scalability, and real-time updates. Dependencies: s3
6. Security, Compliance, and Deployment Engineering (Priority: 6, Expertise: Cloud engineering, security/DevSecOps, compliance, Azure/DevOps) Description: Implement security/authentication (eg. Azure AAD), compliance tracking (GDPR, HIPAA, IEEE), metadata/tagging, and secure deployment pipelines. Prepare for cloud/edge deployment (Azure/in-model). Configure monitoring, role-based access, and ensure regulatory auditability. Dependencies: s3, s5
7. Performance Optimization and Scalability (Priority: 7, Expertise: Performance engineering, distributed systems, graph databases/networks) Description: Engineer performance aspects: graph partitioning, vector similarity indexing, RDMA networking, caching, simulation of high loads, dynamic scaling for knowledge base expansion and multimodal queries. Stress test modules with Chaos Injector and Concurrency Manager. Dependencies: s3, s4, s5
8. Documentation, Test Case Development, and Validation (Priority: 8, Expertise: Technical writing, QA/testing, software documentation) Description: Produce detailed documentation for APIs, data schemas, simulation modules, and frontend. Develop comprehensive test cases for functionality, compliance (validation, auditability), and performance (chaos, concurrency tests). Plan for continuous validation and roadmap iteration. Dependencies: s3, s4, s5, s6, s7
